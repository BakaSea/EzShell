NAME
       rm - remove files or directories

SYNOPSIS
       rm [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the GNU version of rm.  rm removes each specified file.  By default, it does not remove directories.

       If  the  -I or --interactive=once option is given, and there are more than three files or the -r, -R, or --recursive are given, then rm prompts
       the user for whether to proceed with the entire operation.  If the response is not affirmative, the entire command is aborted.

       Otherwise, if a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal, and the -f or --force option is not given, or the -i or  --interactive=always
       option is given, rm prompts the user for whether to remove the file.  If the response is not affirmative, the file is skipped.

OPTIONS
       Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).

       -i     prompt before every removal

       -r, -R, --recursive
              remove directories and their contents recursively

       --help display this help and exit
